  We have all heard too many stories of toxic elements spilling in waterways, threatening wildlife, and destroying entire ecosystems. Worse are the stories of contaminants going unaddressed for years, wreaking a silent devastation on communities. These images are also a fitting description of how our faith can turn toxic. Along the way, rogue thoughts, beliefs, and habits are spilled sometimes by others, sometimes by ourselves onto the shores and riverbanks of our hearts and minds. The damage of these things can be immediate or gradual but the toxic effects remain the same.
