  If we are being transformed into the image of Jesus and promised to be made like him, then he is one we are to imitate. The invitation to walk this way is not an idealistic burden. It is not a command to live against our nature, but, in fact, the kind and gracious offer to live and thrive in light of our true nature in Christ.
