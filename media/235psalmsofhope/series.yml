  Psalms are a purposefully arranged collection of songs and prayers. Itâ€™s worship book for the formation and nourishment of hope and faith in despairing times. Yet, not hope in some general sense: storied hope. Hope rooted in the storied promise of the representative sent by God who would rescue his people from exile, bring justice, and restore creation.
